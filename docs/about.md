This a resource to document different technologies that I encounter or have an interest in.  I have been using github to do this but I wanted to use a platform that was more expressive.  The topics and technologies I'm interested in are:

* cryptography
* virtual private networks (vpn)
* service provider technologies
* security
* design
* best practices
